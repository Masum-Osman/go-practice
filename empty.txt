ChatGPT: Optimizing
Language Models
for Dialogue

Weâ€™ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer
 followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, 
 which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
